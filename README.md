# Age Calculator in Python
My first Python project! This program calculates exact age in years, months, and days.
Age Calculator in Python: A simple Python program that calculates a user's exact age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth. It uses the datetime module, handles user input, and displays total days lived. Great for beginners learning Python basics and date manipulation.

## What it does:
- Takes user's date of birth as input
- Calculates precise age using Python's datetime module
- Shows total days alive
- Gives a motivational message at the end

## How to run:
- **Clone or download** this repository to your computer or open it in an online IDE (like Replit or Google Colab).
- Open a terminal or Python environment in the project folder.
- Run the script:

python age_calculator.py

- **Follow the prompts** to enter your birth year, month, and day.

## Example

=== AGE CALCULATOR ===
Enter your date of birth
Enter your birth year (e.g., 2005): 2005
Enter your birth month (1-12): 7
Enter your birth day (1-31): 22

ðŸŽ‰ You are 20 years, 0 months, and 0 days old!
Total days alive: 7305
Perfect time to start, neither late nor early!

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming basics (input/output, variables, control flow)
- Using Pythonâ€™s `datetime` module for date arithmetic
- Basic logic and arithmetic calculations
- Writing user-friendly programs

## Possible Improvements

- Add error handling and input validation
- Support different date input formats (DD-MM-YYYY, etc.)
- Create a GUI version using Tkinter
- Develop a web version using Flask or Streamlit
